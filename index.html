                    <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <P>Hi! I am  Claire, a passionate photographer with an eye for capturing the realand beautiful human moments. My journey began with a simple camera and curiosity for the world around me. Over the past 10 years, that curiosity transformed into a deep love and interest for storytelling through photographs.
    
                        Whether it is the sparkle in someone’s eye, the burst of laughter between friends and family — I live for those cursory moments that say so much without a single word.
                        
                        This website is a collection of my favorite frames — snaps of life as I see it. My work focuses on people, emotion, and light — always striving to tell a story through each image.
                        
                        Thank you for being here. I hope these photos speak to you as much as they speak to me.
                        
                        Let’s keep capturing the beauty in every moment. You are all welcome.Book your appointment today to frame your unforgetable moments.</P>
